hello there, 

<br/>
my name is **yunchi**, i was born and raised in taipei, and just graduated from **CHUK business school** (the chinese university of hong kong) with concentrations in **business analytics & quantitative marketing**. however, i currently work as a junior data engineer in shanghai. i started this blog to document my studies in programming, and i genuinely hope u find it helpful.

apart from my studies and career, i enjoy traveling, dancing and making videos in my free time. i mainly practice twerking & female dancehall recently, they're really fun (highly recommended)!
