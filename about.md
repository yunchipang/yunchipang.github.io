#### **background**

I am currently pursuing a **Master's degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University**, San Jose campus. As a software/data engineer, I enjoy building tools for people, especially the ones that improve efficiency and make lives easier. In particular, I am more interested in backend engineering and working with APIs and databases. I started this blog to document my studies, and I genuinely hope u find it interesting and/or helpful.

**When I'm not in front of my computer screen**, I am probably busy training at dance studios, hitting the gym, sipping coffee under the sun, or traveling the world.
