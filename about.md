#### **Background**

I am pursuing a **Master's degree in Computer Science** at **Northeastern University**, San Jose campus. As a software engineer, I specialize in full-stack development and am particularly interested in mobile app development. I love that with the power of programming, we are able to build incredible tools for people, especially the ones that make lives easier. I started this blog to document my studies, and I genuinely hope you find it interesting and/or helpful.

**When I'm not in front of my computer screen**, I am probably busy training at dance studios, hitting the gym, sipping coffee under the sun, or traveling the world.
